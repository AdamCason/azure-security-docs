# Get started with Key Vault Connected Service in Visual Studio (ASP.NET Projects)

This article provides additional guidance after you've added Key Vault to an ASP.NET MVC project through the **Add Connected Services** command in Visual Studio. If you've not already added the service to your project, you can do so at any time by following the instructions in [Add Key Vault to your web application by using Visual Studio Connected Services](vs-key-vault-add-connected-service.md).

See [What happened to my ASP.NET project?](vs-key-vault-aspnet-core-what-happened.md) for the changes made to your project when adding the connected service.

1. Add a secret in your Key Vault in Azure. To get to the right place in the portal, click on the link for **Manage secrets stored in this Key Vault**. If you closed the page or the project, you can navigate to it in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) by choosing **All Services**, under **Security**, choose **Key Vault**, then choose the Key Vault you just created.

   ![Navigating to the portal](media/vs-key-vault-add-connected-service/manage-secrets-link.jpg)

1. In the Key Vault section for the key vault you created, choose **Secrets**, then **Generate/Import**.

   ![Generate/Import a secret](media/vs-key-vault-add-connected-service/generate-secrets.jpg)

1. Enter a secret, such as **MySecret**, and give it any string value as a test, then choose the **Create** button.

   ![Create a secret](media/vs-key-vault-add-connected-service/create-a-secret.jpg)
 
1. (optional) Enter another secret, but this time put it into a category by naming it **Secrets--MySecret**. This syntax specifies a category **Secrets** that contains a secret **MySecret**.

1. Add the following lines to web.config. These values are keys that you will use to get the values of secrets in Key Vault.

   ```xml
   <!-- ClientId and ClientSecret refer to the web application registration with Azure Active Directory -->
    <add key="ClientId" value="clientid" />
    <add key="ClientSecret" value="clientsecret" />

    <!-- SecretUri is the URI for the secret in Azure Key Vault -->
    <add key="SecretUri" value="secreturi" />
   ```

1. Add a new class such as Utils to get a Token for Key Vault. Use the following code in the new class:

   ```csharp
   public class Utils
    {
        //this is an optional property to hold the secret after it is retrieved
        public static string EncryptSecret { get; set; }

        //the method that will be provided to the KeyVaultClient
        public static async Task<string> GetToken(string authority, string resource, string scope)
        {
            var authContext = new AuthenticationContext(authority);
            ClientCredential clientCred = new ClientCredential(WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ClientId"],
                        WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ClientSecret"]);
            AuthenticationResult result = await authContext.AcquireTokenAsync(resource, clientCred);

            if (result == null)
                throw new InvalidOperationException("Failed to obtain token.");

            return result.AccessToken;
        }
    }
   ```

    The GetToken method uses the values from the local appSettings file.

1. Add code to get secrets using Key Vault, using the GetToken callback you just added.

   ```csharp
            var kv = new KeyVaultClient(new KeyVaultClient.AuthenticationCallback(Utils.GetToken));
            var sec = await kv.GetSecretAsync(WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings["SecretUri"]);

            //I put a variable in a Utils class to hold the secret for general application use.
            Utils.EncryptSecret = sec.Value;
   ```

Congratulations, you have now enabled your web app to use Key Vault to access securely stored secrets.

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, delete the resource group. This deletes the Key Vault and related resources. To delete the resource group through the portal:

1. Enter the name of your resource group in the Search box at the top of the portal. When you see the resource group used in this QuickStart in the search results, select it.
2. Select **Delete resource group**.
3. In the **TYPE THE RESOURCE GROUP NAME:** box type in the name of the resource group and select **Delete**.
