# Azure Security Baseline for Key Vault

The Azure Security Baseline for Key Vault contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment.

The baseline for this services is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/overview), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance.

For more information, see [Azure Security Baselines overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview).

## Network Security

*For more information, see [Security Control: Network Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security).*

### 1.1: Protect resources using Network Security Groups or Azure Firewall on your Virtual Network

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/1546).

**Guidance**: Integrate Key Vault with Azure Private Link. 
Azure Private Link Service enables you to access Azure Services (for example, Azure Key Vault) and Azure hosted customer/partner services over a Private Endpoint in your virtual network.
An Azure Private Endpoint is a network interface that connects you privately and securely to a service powered by Azure Private Link. The private endpoint uses a private IP address from your VNet, effectively bringing the service into your VNet. All traffic to the service can be routed through the private endpoint, so no gateways, NAT devices, ExpressRoute or VPN connections, or public IP addresses are needed. Traffic between your virtual network and the service traverses over the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public Internet. You can connect to an instance of an Azure resource, giving you the highest level of granularity in access control.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of Vnets, Subnets, and NICs

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/1547).

**Guidance**: Use Azure Security Center and follow network protection recommendations to help secure your Key Vault configured resources in Azure.

### 1.5: Record network packets and flow logs

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/1550).

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/1551).

**Guidance**: Requirement can be met by configuring Advanced Threat Protection for Key Vault. Advanced threat protection for Azure Key Vault provides an additional layer of security intelligence. This tool detects potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit Key Vault accounts.



When Security Center detects anomalous activity, it displays alerts. It also emails the subscription administrator with details of the suspicious activity and recommendations for how to investigate and remediate the identified threats.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/1553).

**Guidance**: For resource that need access to your Key Vault instances, use Virtual Network Service Tags for the Key Vault Service to define network access controls on Network Security Groups or Azure Firewall. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (e.g., ApiManagement) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.9: Maintain standard security configurations for network devices

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/1554).

**Guidance**: Define and implement standard security configurations for network resources associated with your Azure Key Vault instances with Azure Policy. Use Azure Policy aliases in the "Microsoft.KeyVault" and "Microsoft.Network" namespaces to create custom policies to audit or enforce the network configuration of your Azure Key Vault instances. You may also make use of built-in policy definitions related to Key Vault, such as:

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_queries/edit/1582).

**Guidance**: Service Endpoint for Key Vault allows you to restrict access to Key Vault to specific Subnets.



After firewall rules are in effect, users can only perform Key Vault data plane operations when their requests originate from allowed Subnets or IP ranges. This also applies to accessing Key Vault from the Azure portal. Although users can browse to a key vault from the Azure portal, they might not be able to list keys, secrets, or certificates if their client machine is not in the allowed list. This also affects the Key Vault Picker by other Azure services. Users might be able to see list of key vaults, but not list keys, if firewall rules prevent their client machine.
