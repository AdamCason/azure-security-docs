# Manage a Managed HSM using the Azure CLI 

This article covers how to manage roles for a Managed HSM


> [!NOTE]
> Key Vault supports two types of resource: vaults and managed HSMs. This article is about **Managed HSM**. If you want to learn how to manage a vault, please see [Manage Key Vault using the Azure CLI ](../general/manage-with-cli2.md).

For an overview of Managed HSM, see [What is Managed HSM?](overview.md)
If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To use the Azure CLI commands in this article, you must have the following items:

* A subscription to Microsoft Azure. If you don't have one, you can sign up for a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial).
* Azure Command-Line Interface version 2.0 or later. To install the latest version, see [Install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
* An application that will be configured to use the key or password that you create in this article. A sample application is available from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=45343). For instructions, see the included Readme file.

### Getting help with Azure Cross-Platform Command-Line Interface

This article assumes that you're familiar with the command-line interface (Bash, Terminal, Command prompt).

The --help or -h parameter can be used to view help for specific commands. Alternately, The Azure help [command] [options] format can also be used too. When in doubt about the parameters needed by a command, refer to help. For example, the following commands all return the same information:

```azurecli
az account set --help
az account set -h
```

You can also read the following articles to get familiar with Azure Resource Manager in Azure Cross-Platform Command-Line Interface:

* [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
* [Get started with Azure CLI](/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli)
