# Data security posture management (preview)

In today's fast-paced world of constant data migration and increasingly complex cloud environments, it's essential for you to identify and protect your most critical assets from potential cyberattacks. Attacks that expose sensitive information of millions customers are common place, for example due to misconfigured firewalls in a company's cloud infrastructure.

With data sensitivity posture management (DSPM), you can automatically discover and assess your cloud data estate, identify your most critical assets and sensitive data, and prioritize remediation of potential attack paths for resources that are exposed to high risk. The result is greater visibility and insight into where critical data is located and how best to protect it, ensuring that your personal identification and financial information remains secure and protected.

You can enable DSPM with the **Sensitive data discovery** option in Defender CSPM or Defender for Storage.
