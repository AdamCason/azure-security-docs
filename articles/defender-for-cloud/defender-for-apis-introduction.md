# Overview of Microsoft Defender for APIs

Microsoft Defender for APIs is a plan provided by Microsoft Defender for Cloud that offers full lifecycle protection, detection, and response coverage for APIs. 

The service empowers security practitioners to gain visibility into their business-critical APIs, understand their security posture, prioritize vulnerability fixes and detect active runtime threats within minutes. Currently the service supports APIs published in Azure API Management. 

Defender for APIs will provide a unified view of APIs published in Azure API Management and a range of security insights, detections, and response capabilities in a central console, making it easier for security teams to manage their API inventory and prioritize remediation efforts. 

Key capabilities in Defender for APIs   

API Inventory: Discover and catalog aggregated view of all managed APIs.  

API Security Insights: Analyze the APIs for security insights including identifying external, unused and/or unauthenticated APIs, attack paths and create recommendations to harden risk surface. 

API Data Classification: Classify APIs receiving or responding with sensitive data to support risk prioritization. 

OWASP API Top 10 Threat Detection: Detect exploits of the OWASP API top 10 vulnerabilities through runtime observation for anomalies using ML-based and rule-based detections. Detect runtime threats by ingesting API traffic and monitoring the traffic for compromise. 

Threat response: Integrate or export detection alerts into SIEM systems for investigation for continuity of existing threat response workflows. Learn more. 

Integration with Cloud Security Graph in Defender Cloud Security Posture Management (DCSPM): Enable security teams to easily query API inventory, insights and recommendations within the cloud security graph for prioritized remediation and further determine the scope of potential breach through attack path analysis. 

Native API security integration in Azure API Management: Enable Defender for APIs plan and receive API security recommendations and alerts natively in Azure API Management portal.
