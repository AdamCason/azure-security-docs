# Overview of Microsoft Defender for APIs

Microsoft Defender for APIs is a plan provided by Microsoft Defender for Cloud that offers full lifecycle protection, detection, and response coverage for APIs.

Defender for APIs helps you to gain visibility into business-critical APIs. Within minutes, you can analyze your API security posture, prioritize vulnerability fixes, and detect active runtime threats.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Defender for APIs is currently in PREVIEW.
> See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

Currently Defender for APIs provides a unified view of APIs published in Azure API Management. In a single console you can see security insights, detections, and response options, making it easier to manage your API inventory, and prioritize remediation efforts.

What can I do with Defender for APIs?

- **Inventory**: Discover and catalog an aggregated view of all managed APIs.  
- **Insights**: Analyze APIs for security insights. Includes identifying external, unused, and unauthenticated APIs, and attack paths, and create recommendations to harden at-risk surfaces. 
- **OWASP Top 10**: Detct OWASP Top 10 critical security threats with runtime anomaly detection using machine-learning and rule-based detection. Detect runtime threats by ingesting API traffic, and monitoring it for compromise.
- **Threat response**: Integrate or export detection alerts into SIEM systems for investigation by existing threat response workflows. Learn more. 
**Defender for Cloud integration**: Integrate with Cloud Security Graph in Defender Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM). Using Cloud Security Explorer, you can query your API inventory, insights and recommendations to prioritize remediation. Use attack path analysis to determine the scope of potential breaches.
- **Azure API Management integration**: When the Defender for APIs plan is enabled, you receive API security recommendations and alerts in Azure API Management portal.
