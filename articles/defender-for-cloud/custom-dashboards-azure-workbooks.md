# Create rich, interactive reports of Defender for Cloud data by using workbooks

[Azure workbooks](../azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview.md) are a flexible canvas that you can use to analyze data and create rich, visual reports in the Azure portal. In workbooks, you can tap into multiple data sources across Azure. You can combine workbooks into unified, interactive experiences.

Workbooks provide a rich set of capabilities for visualizing your Azure data. For detailed information about each visualization type, see the [visualizations examples and documentation](../azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-text-visualizations.md).

In Microsoft Defender for Cloud, you can access built-in workbooks to track your organizationâ€™s security posture. You can also build custom workbooks to view a wide range of data from Defender for Cloud or other supported data sources.

## Use Defender for Cloud gallery workbooks

With the integrated Azure Workbooks functionality, Microsoft Defender for Cloud makes it straightforward to build your own custom, interactive workbooks. Defender for Cloud also includes a gallery that has the following workbooks ready for you to customize:

- [Coverage workbook](#coverage-workbook): Track the coverage of Defender for Cloud plans and extensions across your environments and subscriptions.
- [Secure Score Over Time workbook](#secure-score-over-time-workbook): Track your subscription scores and changes to recommendations for your resources.
- [System Updates workbook](#system-updates-workbook): View missing system updates by resource, OS, severity, and more.
- [Vulnerability Assessment Findings workbook](#vulnerability-assessment-findings-workbook): View the findings of vulnerability scans of your Azure resources.
- [Compliance Over Time workbook](#compliance-over-time-workbook): View the status of a subscription's compliance with the regulatory or industry standards that you've selected.
- [Active Alerts workbook](#active-alerts-workbook): View active alerts by severity, type, tag, MITRE ATT&CK tactics, and location.
- Price Estimation workbook: View monthly, consolidated price estimations for Microsoft Defender for Cloud plans based on the resource telemetry in your own environment. The numbers are estimates based on retail prices and don't represent actual billing or invoice data.
- Governance workbook: Use the governance report in the governance rules settings to track progress of the rules that are effective in the organization.
- [DevOps Security (Preview) workbook](#devops-security-workbook): View a customizable foundation that helps you visualize the state of your DevOps posture for the connectors you've set up.

Along with built-in workbooks, you can find other useful workbooks in the **Community** category. These workbooks are provided as-is and have no SLA or support. You can choose one of the supplied workbooks or create your own.

### Coverage workbook

Enabling Defender for Cloud across multiple subscriptions and environments (Azure, AWS, and GCP) can make it hard to keep track of which plans are active. This is especially true if you have multiple subscriptions and environments.

The Coverage workbook allows you to keep track of which Defender for Cloud plans are active on which parts of your environments. This workbook can help you to ensure that your environments and subscriptions are fully protected. By having access to detailed coverage information, you can also identify any areas that might need other protection and take action to address those areas.

:::image type="content" source="media/custom-dashboards-azure-workbooks/coverage.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Coverage workbook display the plans and extensions that are enabled in various subscriptions and environments." lightbox="media/custom-dashboards-azure-workbooks/coverage.png":::

In this workbook, you can select a subscription (or all subscriptions), and then view the following tabs:

- **Additional information**: Shows release notes and an explanation of each toggle.
- **Relative coverage**: Shows the percentage of subscriptions or connectors that have a specific Defender for Cloud plan enabled.
- **Absolute coverage**: Shows each plan's status per subscription.
- **Detailed coverage**: Shows additional settings that can be enabled or must need to be enabled on relevant plans to get each plan's full value.

You can also select the Azure, Amazon Web Services, or Google Cloud Platform environment in each or all subscriptions to see which plans and extensions are enabled for that environment.

### Secure Score Over Time workbook

This workbook uses secure score data from your Log Analytics workspace. The data must be exported from the continuous export tool as described in [Configure continuous export from the Defender for Cloud pages in the Azure portal](continuous-export.md?tabs=azure-portal).

When you set up continuous export, under **Export frequency**, select both **Streaming updates** and **Snapshots (Preview)**.

:::image type="content" source="media/custom-dashboards-azure-workbooks/export-frequency-both.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the export frequency options to select for continuous export in the Secure Score Over Time workbook.":::

> [!NOTE]
> Snapshots are exported weekly. There's a delay of at least one week after the first snapshot is exported before you can view data in the workbook.

> [!TIP]
> To configure continuous export across your organization, use the supplied `DeployIfNotExist` policies in Azure Policy that are described in [Configure continuous export at scale](continuous-export.md?tabs=azure-policy).

The Secure Score Over Time workbook has five graphs for the subscriptions that report to the selected workspaces:

### Active Alerts workbook

This workbook displays the active security alerts for your subscriptions on one dashboard. Security alerts are the notifications that Defender for Cloud generates when it detects threats on your resources. Defender for Cloud prioritizes and lists the alerts with the information you need to quickly investigate and remediate.

This workbook benefits you by letting you understand the active threats on your environment, and allows you to prioritize between the active alerts.

> [!NOTE]
> Most workbooks use Azure Resource Graph to query data. For example, to display Map View, a Log Analytics workspace is used to query the data. [Continuous export](continuous-export.md) should be enabled. Export the security alerts to the Log Analytics workspace.

You can view the active alerts by severity, resource group, or tag.
