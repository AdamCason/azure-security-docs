# Create rich, interactive reports of Defender for Cloud data by using workbooks

[Azure workbooks](../azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview.md) are a flexible canvas that you can use to analyze data and create rich, visual reports in the Azure portal. In workbooks, you can tap into multiple data sources across Azure. You can combine workbooks into unified, interactive experiences.

Workbooks provide a rich set of capabilities for visualizing your Azure data. For detailed information about each visualization type, see the [visualizations examples and documentation](../azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-text-visualizations.md).

In Microsoft Defender for Cloud, you can access built-in workbooks to track your organizationâ€™s security posture. You can also build custom workbooks to view a wide range of data from Defender for Cloud or other supported data sources.

### Coverage workbook

If you enable Defender for Cloud across multiple subscriptions and environments (Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud Platform), you might find it challenging to keep track of which plans are active. It's especially true if you have multiple subscriptions and environments.

The Coverage workbook helps you keep track of which Defender for Cloud plans are active in which parts of your environments. This workbook can help you ensure that your environments and subscriptions are fully protected. By having access to detailed coverage information, you can also identify areas that might need more protection so that you can take action to address those areas.

:::image type="content" source="media/custom-dashboards-azure-workbooks/coverage.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Coverage workbook, which displays the plans and extensions that are enabled in various subscriptions and environments." lightbox="media/custom-dashboards-azure-workbooks/coverage.png":::

In this workbook, you can select a subscription (or all subscriptions), and then view the following tabs:

- **Additional information**: Shows release notes and an explanation of each toggle.
- **Relative coverage**: Shows the percentage of subscriptions or connectors that have a specific Defender for Cloud plan enabled.
- **Absolute coverage**: Shows each plan's status per subscription.
- **Detailed coverage**: Shows additional settings that can be enabled or must need to be enabled on relevant plans to get each plan's full value.

You also can select the Azure, Amazon Web Services, or Google Cloud Platform environment in each or all subscriptions to see which plans and extensions are enabled for that environment.

### Secure Score Over Time workbook

The Secure Score Over Time workbook uses secure score data from your Log Analytics workspace. The data must be exported from the continuous export tool as described in [Configure continuous export from the Defender for Cloud pages in the Azure portal](continuous-export.md?tabs=azure-portal).

When you set up continuous export, under **Export frequency**, select both **Streaming updates** and **Snapshots (Preview)**.

:::image type="content" source="media/custom-dashboards-azure-workbooks/export-frequency-both.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the export frequency options to select for continuous export in the Secure Score Over Time workbook.":::

> [!NOTE]
> Snapshots are exported weekly. There's a delay of at least one week after the first snapshot is exported before you can view data in the workbook.

> [!TIP]
> To configure continuous export across your organization, use the supplied `DeployIfNotExist` policies in Azure Policy that are described in [Configure continuous export at scale](continuous-export.md?tabs=azure-policy).

The Secure Score Over Time workbook has five graphs for the subscriptions that report to the selected workspaces:

|Graph  |Example  |
|---------|---------|
|**Score trends for the last week and month**<br>Use this section to monitor the current score and general trends of the scores for your subscriptions.|:::image type="content" source="media/custom-dashboards-azure-workbooks/secure-score-over-time-table-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows trends for secure score on the built-in workbook.":::|

### Active Alerts workbook

The Active Alerts workbook displays the active security alerts for your subscriptions on one dashboard. Security alerts are the notifications that Defender for Cloud generates when it detects threats on your resources. Defender for Cloud prioritizes and lists the alerts with the information you need to quickly investigate and remediate.

This workbook benefits you by helping you see the active threats in your environment and prioritize them.

> [!NOTE]
> Most workbooks use Azure Resource Graph to query data. For example, to display Map View, a Log Analytics workspace is used to query the data. [Continuous export](continuous-export.md) should be enabled. Export the security alerts to the Log Analytics workspace.

You can view active alerts by severity, resource group, and tag.
