# View and remediate vulnerabilities for registry images (Risk based)

> [!NOTE]
> This page describes the new risk-based approach to vulnerability management in Defender for Cloud. If you are using the classic secure score approach, see [View and remediate vulnerabilities for registry images (Secure Score)](view-and-remediate-vulnerability-assessment-findings-secure-score.md).

Defender for Cloud gives its customers the ability to remediate vulnerabilities in container images while still stored in the registry. In this article, we'll review the [Container images in Azure registry should have vulnerability findings resolved](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/33422d8f-ab1e-42be-bc9a-38685bb567b9) recommendation. For the other clouds, see the parallel recommendations in  [Vulnerability assessments for AWS with Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](agentless-vulnerability-assessment-aws.md) and [Vulnerability assessments for GCP with Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](agentless-vulnerability-assessment-gcp.md).

Within the recommendation, resources are grouped into tabs:  

- **Healthy resources** – relevant resources, which either aren't impacted or on which you've already remediated the issue.  
- **Unhealthy resources** – resources that are still impacted by the identified issue.  
- **Not applicable resources** – resources for which the recommendation can't give a definitive answer. The not applicable tab also includes reasons for each resource.  

If you are using Defender CSPM, first review and remediate vulnerabilities exposed via [attack paths](how-to-manage-attack-path.md), as they pose the greatest risk to your security posture. Then [view remediate vulnerabilities for running images](view-and-remediate-vulnerabilities-for-images.md), and finally use the following procedures described here to view, remediate, prioritize, and monitor vulnerabilities in your registry images.

## View vulnerabilities on a specific container registry

1. In Defender for Cloud, open the **Recommendations** page. If issues were found, you'll see the recommendation [Container images in Azure registry should have vulnerability findings resolved](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/33422d8f-ab1e-42be-bc9a-38685bb567b9). Select the recommendation.

1. The recommendation details page opens with additional information. This information includes the list of registries with vulnerable images ("Resource") and the remediation steps. Select the affected registry.

1. This opens the registry details with a list of repositories in it that have vulnerable images. Select the affected repository to see the images in it that are vulnerable.

1. The repository details page opens. It lists all vulnerable images on that repository with distribution of the severity of vulnerabilities per image. Select the unhealthy image to see the vulnerabilities.

    :::image type="content" source="media/view-and-remediate-vulnerability-assessment-findings/select-unhealthy-image.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to select the unhealthy image." lightbox="media/view-and-remediate-vulnerability-assessment-findings/select-unhealthy-image.png":::

1. The list of vulnerabilities for the selected image opens. To learn more about a finding, select the finding.

1. The vulnerabilities details pane opens. This pane includes a detailed description of the issue and links to external resources to help mitigate the threats, affected resources, and information on the software version that contributes to resolving the vulnerability.

You can also group recommendations by title. This is useful when you want to remediate a recommendation that is affecting multiple resources caused by a specific security issue. For more information, see [Group recommendations by title](review-security-recommendations.md#group-recommendations-by-title).

For information on how to remediate the vulnerabilities, see [Remediate recommendations](implement-security-recommendations.md).

## View images affected by a specific vulnerability

1. Open the **Recommendations** page. If issues were found, you'll see the recommendation [Container images in Azure registry should have vulnerability findings resolved](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/33422d8f-ab1e-42be-bc9a-38685bb567b9). Select the recommendation.

1. The recommendation details page opens with additional information. Select the **Findings** tab to see the list of vulnerabilities impacting the images. Select a specific vulnerability.

    :::image type="content" source="media/view-and-remediate-vulnerability-assessment-findings/select-specific-vulnerability.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the list of vulnerabilities impacting the images." lightbox="media/view-and-remediate-vulnerability-assessment-findings/select-specific-vulnerability.png":::

1. The vulnerability finding details pane opens. This pane includes a detailed description of the vulnerability, images affected by that vulnerability, and links to external resources to help mitigate the threats, affected resources, and information on the software version that contributes to resolving the vulnerability.
