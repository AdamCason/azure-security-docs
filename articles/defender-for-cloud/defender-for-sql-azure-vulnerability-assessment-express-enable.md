# Enable vulnerability assessment on your Azure SQL databases without a storage account (Express)

## Prerequisites

- Make sure that [Microsoft Defender for Azure SQL](defender-for-databases-introduction.md) is enabled so that you can run scans on your Azure SQL databases.
- Make sure you read and understand the [differences between the express and classic configuration](defender-for-sql-azure-vulnerability-assessment-overview.md#whats-the-difference-between-the-express-and-classic-configuration).

## Enable vulnerability assessment using the express configuration without a storage account (Preview)

To enable vulnerability assessment without a storage account, use the express configuration:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. Open the specific Azure SQL Database resource. 
1. Under the Security heading, select **Defender for Cloud**.
1. Enable the express configuration of vulnerability assessment:
   
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Baselines and scan history are not migrated.
   
   - **If vulnerability assessment is not properly configured**, you are prompted to enable vulnerability assessment using the express configuration:

      You see the same prompt if you select **Configure** on the link to open the Microsoft Defender for SQL settings pane for the entire server:

      Select **Enable** to use the vulnerability assessment express configuration.

   - **If vulnerability assessment is already properly configured**, you are prompted to switch to express configuration:

      Select **Enable** to use the vulnerability assessment express configuration and select **Confirm** to implement the change.

Go to the SQL databases should have vulnerability findings resolved recommendation to see the vulnerabilities found in your databases.

You can also run on-demand vulnerability assessment scans to see the current findings.

## Enable express vulnerability assessment at scale

Follow the instructions to enable the Microsoft Defender for SQL plan at the subscription level. 

If you enabled the plan at the subscription level after Express Configuration became available then all Azure SQL Servers under the selected subscription will have both Advanced Threat Protection and Vulnerability Assessment configured. 

Otherwise, no Azure SQL Servers, new or existing, will have VA automatically turned on with Express Configuration at this point.
