# Protect servers with agentless malware scanning

Microsoft Defender for Cloud's Defenders for Servers plan 2 provides an agentless malware scanning capability that scans and detects malware and viruses. The scanner is available for Azure virtual machines (VM), AWS EC2 instances and GCP VM instances.

Agentless malware scanning provides:

- Up-to-date and comprehensive malware detection capabilities that use [Microsoft Defender Antivirus](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-antivirus-windows?view=o365-worldwide)'s cloud protection signature feed that is supported by Microsoft's intelligence feeds.

- Quick and full scans that use heuristic and signature-based threat detection. 

- Security alerts that are generated when malware is detected. These alerts provide extra details and context for investigations, and are sent to both the Defender for Cloud Alerts page and Defender XDR.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Agentless malware scanning is only available through Defender for Servers plan 2 with agentless scanning enabled.

## Agentless malware detection

Agentless malware scanning offers the following benefits to both protected and unprotected machines:

- **Improved coverage** - If a machine doesn't have an antivirus solution enabled, the agentless detector will scan that machine to detect malicious activity.  

- **Frictionless onboarding, less maintenance, lower provisioning costs** - Onboarding to multicloud machines is faster than agent-based onboarding.

- **Detect potential threats** - The agentless scanner scans all files and folders including those that are excluded from the agent-based antivirus scans, without having an effect on the performance of the machine.  

## Benefits of deploying both the agent-based and agentless detector

By employing both the agent-based and agentless malware detectors, you can take advantage of all of the [benefits of the agentless malware detector](#agentless-malware-detection) and supplement them with the benefits of the agent-based malware detector. The agent-based detector offers benefits such as, deep visibility, real time protection, behavioral analysis and response. 

Enabling both solutions provides you with a dual layer of protection and benefits that isn't possible with just one of the solutions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Security alerts appear on the portal only in cases where threats are detected on your environment. If you do not have any alerts it may be because there are no threats on your environment. You can [validate that the device is properly onboarded and reporting to Defender for Cloud](enable-agentless-scanning-vms.md#validate-onboarding-of-the-agentless-malware-scanning-capability).

On the Security alerts page, you can [manage and respond to security alerts](managing-and-responding-alerts.md). You can also [review the agentless malware scanner's results](managing-and-responding-alerts.md#review-the-agentless-scans-results). Security alerts can also be [exported to Sentinel](export-to-siem.md).
