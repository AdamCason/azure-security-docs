# Protect servers with agentless malware scanning

The Defender for Servers plan in Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides an agentless malware scanning for Azure virtual machines (VM), AWS EC2 instances and GCP VM instances. Agentless scanning adds to the existing agent-based scanning in Defender for Servers, which uses [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint's](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md) engine to scan and detect malware and virus threats. Agentless malware scanning triggers security alerts in Defender for Cloud. You can then investigate any detected threats. Agentless 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Agentless malware scanning is only available through Defender for Servers plan 2 with agentless scanning enabled.

With agentless malware scanning you get:

- Comprehensive malware detection capabilities using [Microsoft Defender Antivirus](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-antivirus-windows?view=o365-worldwide) cloud protection signature feed, supported by Microsoft's intelligence feeds and research enrichment.

- Security alerts are generated When malware is detected during a scan, that provide extra details and context to aid in further investigation.

## Agentless malware detection

The benefits of agentless malware detection are:

- Onboarding to multicloud machines is easier and faster than agent-based onboarding.

- Coverage on machines that don't have an anti-malware solution installed due to incompatibility with an agent-based solution.

- Eliminate the time gap that can occur between deployed and the workload owners onboarding the agent to every device added to the environment.

- Scans on agent-based files and folders that were excluded from agent-based anti-virus and anti-malware scans.

You can learn more about [agentless machine scanning](concept-agentless-data-collection.md) and how to [enable agentless scanning for VMs](enable-agentless-scanning-vms.md).

## Benefits of combining agentless and agent-based scanners

By employing both the agent-based and agentless scanners, you can take advantage of the benefits of each feature, providing you with a dual layer of protection and benefits that isn't possible with just one of the features.

The following table summarizes these benefits:

### Agentless malware detection

An agentless approach to malware detection provides several advantages that are often overlooked when relying solely on an agent-based anti-malware detector. You can protect your servers with an agentless malware detection solution, which allows you to eliminate concerns about time gap that might occur between a device being deployed and the workload owners onboarding the agent to every device added to the environment. Also, if certain files and folders are excluded from the anti-virus and anti-malware scan, the agentless malware scanner scans these files and folders regardless, providing you with protection without affecting performance.

**Version 2: Version 2: Version 2:Version 2:Version 2:Version 2:Version 2:Version 2:Version 2:Version 2:Version 2:Version 2:**

Agentless malware detection on machines improves your malware detection coverage without any effect on your machine's performance and without an agent footprint. The agentless malware scanner returns results within hours and provides several advantages that are often overlooked when relying solely on an agent-based anti-malware solution:

- Coverage on machines that don't have an anti-malware solution installed due to incompatibility with an agent-based solution.
- Easier and faster onboarding to multicloud machines.
- Receive security alerts without the need of any extra installation or configuration. 
- The ability to detect potential threats that might exist in files and folders that are excluded from the agent-based anti-virus and anti-malware scan.
