# Protect servers with agentless malware scanning

Microsoft Defender for Cloud's Defenders for Servers plan 2 provides an agentless malware scanning capability that scans and detects malware and viruses. The scanner is available for Azure virtual machines (VM), AWS EC2 instances and GCP VM instances.

Agentless malware scanning provides:

- Up-to-date and comprehensive malware detection capabilities that use [Microsoft Defender Antivirus](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-antivirus-windows?view=o365-worldwide)'s cloud protection signature feed that is supported by Microsoft's intelligence feeds.

- Quick and full scans that use heuristic and signature-based threat detection. 

- Security alerts that are generated when malware is detected. These alerts provide extra details and context for investigations, and are sent to both the Defender for Cloud Alerts page and Defender XDR.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Agentless malware scanning is only available through Defender for Servers plan 2 with agentless scanning enabled.

## Agentless malware detection

Agentless malware scanning offers the following benefits to both protected and unprotected machines:

- **Improved coverage** - agentless malware scanning covers machines that aren't protected with other Anti-virus solution. Acting as the only source to detect malicious activity within those machines. 

- **Frictionless onboarding, less maintenance, lower provisioning costs** - Onboarding to multicloud machines is easier and faster than agent-based onboarding.

- **Detecting potential threats** - Scans on files and folders that are excluded from the Anti-Virus scans, without any effect on the performance of the machine.  

## Benefits of deploying both the agent-based and agentless detector

By employing both the agent-based and agentless malware detectors, you can take advantage of all of the [benefits of the agentless malware detector](#agentless-malware-detection) and supplement them with the benefits of the agent-based malware detector. The agent-based detector offers benefits such as, deep visibility, real time protection, behavioral analysis and response. 

Enabling both solutions provides you with a dual layer of protection and benefits that isn't possible with just one of the solutions.
