# Protect your servers with agentless malware scanning

Defender for Cloud's agentless malware scanning for virtual machines (VM), uses [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint's](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md) engine to scan and detect malware and various threats. The agentless malware scanner triggers security alerts in Defender for Cloud that allow you to investigate any detected threats.

## Requirements

- An Azure account. If you don't already have an Azure account, you can [create your Azure free account today](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](connect-azure-subscription.md) enabled on your Azure subscription.
- [Enable Defender for Servers plan 2](tutorial-enable-servers-plan.md#select-a-defender-for-servers-plan)

## Agentless malware scanning

An agentless approach to malware scanning on servers provides several advantages that are often overlooked when relying solely on an agent-based scanner. By using an agentless scanner you gain:

- Comprehensive anti-malware capabilities using [Microsoft Defender Antivirus (MDAV)](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-antivirus-windows?view=o365-worldwide), which uses a heuristic and signature-based threat detection aimed at catching polymorphic and metamorphic malware. 

- The latest protection available for your servers via the most current MDAV cloud protection signature feed, supported by Microsoft's intelligence feeds and research enrichment.

- When malware is detected during a scan, security alerts are generated that provide extra details and context to aid in further investigation.

An agentless approach to malware scanning provides several advantages that are often overlooked when relying solely on an agent-based scanner. By using an agentless scanner, you can eliminate concerns about the time gap that occurs between a device being deployed and the workload owners onboarding the agent to every device added to the environment. If resource owners exempted certain files and folders due to performance concerns, the agentless scanner scans these files and folders regardless. Agentless scanning doesn't affect machine performance since the scan takes place in the cloud, which allows you to offload deep scan performances from the agent-based machines.

## Benefits of combining agentless and agent-based scanners

By employing both the agent-based and agentless scanners, you can take advantage of the benefits of each service, providing you with a dual layer of protection and benefits that isn't possible with just one scanner.

The following table shows the list of benefits gained by each type of agent:

| **Agent-based endpoint protection** | **Agentless malware scanning** |
|--|--|
| Real time monitoring and detection of attacks | Frictionless onboarding, minimal maintenance, lower provisioning costs |
| Behavioral analysis and response | Complete coverage |
| Remediation and response capabilities | No effect on performance due to no presence on the machine |
| Deep OS visibility and threat detection abilities, such as processes, communications and more | Deep and full scan to detect threats on all files and resources (including agent-based excluded files and resources)|
|Active ability to enforce policies, prevent, respond and remediate attacks| No limitation due to incompatible operating systems or machines |

## Review the agentless scan's results

Results for both the agent-based and agentless scanner appear on the Security alerts page.

The alerts generated by the agentless scan include the word agentless in parenthesis." lightbox="media/concept-agentless-data-collection/agent-and-agentless-results.png":::

> [!NOTE]
> Remediating one of these alerts will not remediate the other alert until the next scan is completed.

On the Security alerts page, you can [manage and respond to security alerts](managing-and-responding-alerts.md). Security alerts can also be [exported to Sentinel](export-to-siem.md).
