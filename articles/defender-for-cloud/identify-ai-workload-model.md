# Discover generative AI applications

Defender for Cloud provides a comprehensive view of your organization's AI bill of materials (AIBOM). By using the cloud security explorer, you can identify the AI workloads and models that are running in your environment and assess their security posture.

## Prerequisites

- Read about [AI security posture management](ai-security-posture.md).

- You need a Microsoft Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can [sign up for a free subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

- [Defender for Cloud on your Azure subscription](connect-azure-subscription.md).

- Enable [Defender Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)](tutorial-enable-cspm-plan.md) on your Azure subscription.

- Have at least oneâ€¯AI supported workload (Azure Open AI, AWS account).

## Discover AI workloads and models in use

You can use the cloud security explorer to identify generative AI workloads and models running in your environment, you can use the cloud security explorer to identify them. 

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Search for and select **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** > **Cloud Security Explorer**.

1. Select the **AI workloads and models in use** query template.

1. Select **Search**.

1. Select a result to review its details.
