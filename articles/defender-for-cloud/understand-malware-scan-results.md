# Understanding malware scanning results

When a blob is scanned for malware, the scan result can be accessed in a number of ways: 

A blob index tag: and index tag with the key “Malware Scanning scan result” (Note that index tags are not supported in storage accounts with Hierarchical namespaces enabled). 

An Event Grid message: This allows you to automate responses to scan results. It requires additional configuration. Learn more about [setting up event grid for malware scanning](advanced-configurations-for-malware-scanning.md#setting-up-event-grid-for-malware-scanning).

A Log Analytics Workspace log entry: By utilizing this method, you can store all scan results in a centralized log repository. This repository is designed for easy querying, making it a powerful tool for tracking, and analyzing scan results. Learn more about [setting up logging for malware scanning](advanced-configurations-for-malware-scanning.md#setting-up-logging-for-malware-scanning) and the [event grid](defender-for-storage-malware-scan.md#event-grid-event) message structure.

A security alert in Defender for Cloud (if malware was detected): You can read more about Microsoft [Defender for Cloud security alerts](alerts-overview.md#what-are-security-alerts).

Whether you're looking to [automate responses](defender-for-storage-configure-malware-scan.md#set-up-automation) to specific scan outcomes or to simply keep a detailed record of all scans, these options can be tailored to meet your needs.

Scan results are of two categories: successful states and error states. Understanding these states is important for interpreting the results of Malware Scanning and taking appropriate action. 

> [!NOTE]
> For storage accounts that exceed the [throughput capacity and blob size limits](defender-for-storage-malware-scan.md#throughput-capacity-and-blob-size-limit) for Defender for Storage malware scanning, some blobs will not be scanned and will not have a scan result.
