# Vulnerability assessments for Azure with Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management

> [!NOTE]
> This feature supports scanning of images in the Azure Container Registry (ACR) only. If you want to find vulnerabilities stored in other container registries, you can import the images into ACR, after which the imported images are scanned by the built-in vulnerability assessment solution. Learn how to [import container images to a container registry](/azure/container-registry/container-registry-import-images).

- Container registry vulnerability assessment scans images in your Azure Container Registry (ACR) to provide recommendations for improving your posture by remediating vulnerabilities.

- Vulnerability assessment for Containers in Defender Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) gives you frictionless, wide, and instant visibility on actionable posture issues without the need for installed agents, network connectivity requirements, or container performance impact.

Container registries vulnerability assessment, powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management (MDVM), is an out-of-box solution that empowers security teams to discover vulnerabilities in your Azure  Container images by providing frictionless native coverage in Azure for vulnerability scanning of container images.

Azure Container Vulnerability Assessment provides automatic coverage for all registries and images in Azure, for each subscription where the CSPM plan is enabled, without any extra configuration of users or registries. New images are automatically scanned once a day and vulnerability reports for previously scanned images are refreshed daily.

Container vulnerability assessment powered by MDVM (Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management) has the following capabilities:  

- **Scanning OS packages** - container vulnerability assessment has the ability to scan vulnerabilities in packages installed by the OS package manager in Linux. See the [full list of the supported OS and their versions](support-agentless-containers-posture.md#registries-and-images---powered-by-mdvm).
- **Language specific packages** – support for language specific packages and files, and their dependencies installed or copied without the OS package manager. See the [complete list of supported languages](support-agentless-containers-posture.md#registries-and-images---powered-by-mdvm).  
- **Image scanning in Azure Private Link** - Azure container vulnerability assessment provides the ability to scan images in container registries that are accessible via Azure Private Links. This capability requires access to trusted services and authentication with the registry. Learn how to [connect privately to an Azure container registry using Azure Private Link](/azure/container-registry/container-registry-private-link#set-up-private-endpoint---portal-recommended).
- **Exploitability information** - Each vulnerability report is searched through exploitability databases to assist our customers with determining actual risk associated with each reported vulnerability.  
- **Reporting** - Defender for Containers powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management (MDVM)  reports the vulnerabilities as the following recommendations:

    | Recommendation | Description | Assessment Key
    |--|--|--|
    | Container registry images should have vulnerability findings resolved (powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management)-Preview | Container image vulnerability assessment scans your registry for commonly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) and provides a detailed vulnerability report for each image. Resolving vulnerabilities can greatly improve your security posture, ensuring images are safe to use prior to deployment. | c0b7cfc6-3172-465a-b378-53c7ff2cc0d5 |
    | Running container images should have vulnerability findings resolved (powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management) | Container image vulnerability assessment scans your registry for commonly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) and provides a detailed vulnerability report for each image. This recommendation provides visibility to vulnerable images currently running in your Kubernetes clusters. Remediating vulnerabilities in container images that are currently running is key to improving your security posture, significantly reducing the attack surface for your containerized workloads. | c609cf0f-71ab-41e9-a3c6-9a1f7fe1b8d5 |

- **Query vulnerability information via the Azure Resource Graph** - Ability to query vulnerability information via the [Azure Resource Graph](/azure/governance/resource-graph/overview#how-resource-graph-complements-azure-resource-manager). Learn how to [query recommendations via the ARG](review-security-recommendations.md#review-recommendation-data-in-azure-resource-graph-arg).
- **Query vulnerability information via sub-assessment API** - You can get scan results via REST API. See the [subassessment list](/rest/api/defenderforcloud/sub-assessments/get?tabs=HTTP).
- **Support for exemptions** - Learn how to  [create exemption rules for a management group, resource group, or subscription](how-to-enable-agentless-containers.md#support-for-exemptions).
- **Support for disabling vulnerability findings** - Learn how to [disable vulnerability assessment findings on Container registry images](disable-vulnerability-findings-containers.md).

## Scan Triggers

The triggers for an image scan are:

- **One-time triggering** – each image added to a container registry is scanned within 24 hours.
- **Continuous rescan triggering** – Continuous rescan is required to ensure images that have been previously scanned for vulnerabilities are rescanned to update their vulnerability reports in case a new vulnerability is published.
  - **Re-scan** is performed once a day for:  
    - images pushed in the last 90 days.  
    - images currently running on the Kubernetes clusters monitored by Defender for Cloud (either via agentless discovery and visibility for Kubernetes or Defender for Containers agent).

## How does image scanning work?

Container registry vulnerability assessment scans container images stored in your Azure Container Registry (ACR) as part of the protections provided within Microsoft Defender CSPM. A detailed description of the process is as follows:

1. When you enable the vulnerability assessment extension in Defender CSPM, you authorize Defender CSPM to scan container images in your Azure Container registries.  
1. Defender CSPM automatically discovers all containers registries, repositories and images (created before or after enabling the plan).  
1. Once a day:

   1. All newly discovered images are pulled, and an inventory is created for each image. Image inventory is kept to avoid further image pulls, unless required by new scanner capabilities.​

      1. Using the inventory, vulnerability reports are generated for new images, and updated for images previously scanned which were either pushed in the last 90 days to a registry, or are currently running.

> [!NOTE]
> To determine if an image is currently running, Agentless Vulnerability Assessment uses [Agentless Discovery and Visibility within Kubernetes components](/azure/defender-for-cloud/concept-agentless-containers)

## If I remove an image from my registry, how long before vulnerabilities reports on that image would be removed?

It currently takes 3 days to remove findings for a deleted image. We are working on providing quicker deletion for removed images.
