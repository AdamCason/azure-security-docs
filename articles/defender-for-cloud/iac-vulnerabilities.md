# Tutorial: Discover vulnerabilities in Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Once you have set up the Microsoft Security DevOps Extension, or Workflow, there is additional support located in the YAML configuration that can be used to run a tool, or several of the tools. For example, setting up Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scanning.

## Prerequisites

- [Configure Microsoft Security DevOps GitHub action](msdo-github-action.md).
- [Configure the Microsoft Security DevOps extension](msdo-azure-devops-extension.md).

## View the results of the IaC scan in GitHub 

1. Sign in to [Github](https://www.github.com). 

1. Navigate to the repository home page.

1. Select the **.github/workflows** folder.

1. Select **Edit**.

1. Under the Run Analyzers section, add the following:

    ```yml
    with:

1. Select **Start Commit-\>Commit changes**.

1. (Optional) Skip this step if you already have an IaC template in your repository.

     [Install an IaC template](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/quickstarts/microsoft.web/webapp-basic-linux).

    ```azcopy
    HOW IS THIS DONE???????
    1.  Upload the template to your repository and commit the template to your repository

## View the results of the IaC scan in Azure DevOps

**To view the results of the IaC scan in Azure DevOps**

1. Sign into [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/)

1. Navigate to **Pipeline**.

1. Locate the pipeline with MSDO Azure DevOps Extension configured.

2. Select **Edit**.

3. Add the following lines to the YAML file
