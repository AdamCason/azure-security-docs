# Security recommendations for DevOps resources - a reference guide

This article lists the recommendations you might see in Microsoft Defender for Cloud if you've [connected a DevOps](quickstart-onboard-devops.md) or [Github](quickstart-onboard-github.md) environment from the **Environment settings** page. The recommendations shown in your environment depend on the resources you're protecting and your customized configuration.

To learn about how to respond to these recommendations, see
[Remediate recommendations in Defender for Cloud](implement-security-recommendations.md).

Your secure score is based on the number of security recommendations you've completed. To
decide which recommendations to resolve first, look at the severity of each one and its potential
impact on your secure score.
