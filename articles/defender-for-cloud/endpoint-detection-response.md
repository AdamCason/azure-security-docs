# Endpoint Detection and response solution 

Microsoft Defender for Cloud offers security recommendations that assist you in the process of reducing a machine's [attack surface](concept-attack-path.md) allowing the machine to avoid known risks. Defender for Cloud has several recommendations that ensure an endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution is installed and configured securely and according to compliance standards across all of your environments. 

Defender for Cloud allows you to: 

- Identify whether an EDR is installed on your machines.  

- Identify gaps in your security configurations on any of the discovered EDRs.

- Shows you how to remediate gaps in your security configurations.
