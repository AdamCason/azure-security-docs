# Attack path names and descriptions

This article lists the attack paths you might see in Microsoft Defender for Cloud. The attack paths shown in your environment depend on the resources you're protecting and your customized configuration.

To learn about how to respond to these attack paths, see [Identify and remediate attack paths](how-to-manage-attack-path.md).
