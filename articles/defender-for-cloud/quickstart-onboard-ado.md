# Quickstart: Connect your Azure DevOps to Microsoft Defender for Cloud

With cloud workloads commonly spanning multiple cloud platforms, cloud security services must do the same. Microsoft Defender for Cloud protects workloads in Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Github and Azure DevOps (ADO).

To protect your ADO-based resources, you can connect your ADO account on the environment settings page. This page provides a simple onboarding experience (including auto provisioning). 

Connecting your ADO to Defender for Cloud, extends Defender for Cloud's enhanced security features and CSPM features to your Azure DevOps resources. This feature assesses your ADO resources with ADO-specific security recommendations, that are included in your secure score. Your resources will also be assessed for compliance with built-in standards specific to DevOps. Defender for Cloud's [asset inventory page](asset-inventory.md) is a multi-cloud enabled feature helping you manage your Azure DevOps resources alongside your Azure resources. 

Microsoft Defender for DevOps extends Defender for Cloud’s threat detection capabilities and advanced defenses to your Azure DevOps resources. 

You can view all of the [recommendations for Azure DevOps](recommendations-reference#devops-recommendations) resources.
