      - question: |
          What servers do I pay for in a subscription?
        answer: |
          When you enable Defender for Servers on a subscription, you're charged for all machines based on their power states.

          **Azure VMs:**

          State | Details | Billing
          --- | --- | ---
          Starting | VM starting up. | Not billed
          Running | Normal working state. | Billed
          Stopping | Transitional. Moves to Stopped state when finished. | Billed
          Stopped | VM shut down from within guest OS or by using PowerOff APIs. Hardware is still allocated, and the machine remains on the host. | Billed
          Deallocating | Transitional. Moves to Deallocated state when finished. | Not billed
          Deallocated | VM stopped and removed from the host. | Not billed 

          **Azure Arc machines:**

          **State** | **Details** | **Billing**
          --- | --- | ---
          Connecting | Servers connected, but heartbeat not yet received. | Not billed
          Connected | Receiving regular heartbeat from Connected Machine agent. | Billed
          Offline/Disconnected | No heartbeat received in 15-30 minutes. | Not billed
          Expired | If disconnected for 45 days, status might change to Expired. | Not billed

  
      - question: |
          Do I need to enable Defender for Servers on the subscription and on the workspace?
        answer: |
          Defender for Servers Plan 1 doesn't depend on Log Analytics. When you enable Defender for Servers Plan 2 at the subscription level, Defender for Cloud automatically enables the plan on your default Log Analytics workspaces. If you use a custom workspace, make sure you enable the plan on the workspace. Here's more information:
          
          - If you turn on Defender for Servers for a subscription and for a connected custom workspace, you aren't charged for both. The system identifies unique VMs.
          - If you enable Defender for Servers on cross-subscription workspaces:
            - For the Log Analytics agent, connected machines from all subscriptions are billed, including subscriptions that don't have the Defender for Servers plan enabled.
            - For the Azure Monitor agent, billing and feature coverage for Defender for Servers depends only on the plan being enabled in the subscription.
          
          
      - question: |
          Is the 500 MB of free data ingestion allowance applied per workspace or per machine?
        answer: |
          When you have [Defender for Servers Plan 2](plan-defender-for-servers-select-plan.md) enabled, you get 500 MB of free data ingestion per day. The allowance is specifically for the security data types that are directly collected by Defender for Cloud.
          
          This allowance is a daily rate that's averaged across all nodes. Your total daily free limit is equal to \[number of machines\] &times; 500 MB. You aren't charged extra if the total doesn't exceed your total daily free limit, even if some machines send 100 MB and others send 800 MB.

      - question: |
          What data types are included in the daily allowance?
        answer: |
          Defender for Cloud billing is closely tied to the billing for Log Analytics. [Microsoft Defender for Servers](defender-for-servers-introduction.md) provides an allocation of 500 MB per node per day for machines against the following subset of [security data types](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/tables-category#security):

          - [SecurityAlert](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/securityalert)
          - [SecurityBaseline](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/securitybaseline)
          - [SecurityBaselineSummary](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/securitybaselinesummary)
          - [SecurityDetection](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/securitydetection)
          - [SecurityEvent](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/securityevent)
          - [WindowsFirewall](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/windowsfirewall)
          - [SysmonEvent](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/sysmonevent)
          - [ProtectionStatus](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/protectionstatus)
          - [Update](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/update) and [UpdateSummary](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/updatesummary) when the Update Management solution isn't running in the workspace or solution targeting is enabled.

          If the workspace is in the legacy per-node pricing tier, the Defender for Cloud and Log Analytics allocations are combined and applied jointly to all billable ingested data.

      - question: |
          Am I charged for machines that don't have Log Analytics installed?
        answer: |
          Yes. You're charged for all machines that are protected by Defender for Servers in Azure subscriptions, connected AWS accounts, or connected GCP projects. The term *machines* includes Azure virtual machines, instances of Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets, and Azure Arc-enabled servers. Machines that don't have Log Analytics installed are covered by protections that don't depend on the Log Analytics agent.

      - question: |
          If an agent reports to multiple workspaces, am I charged twice?
        answer: |
          If a machine reports to multiple workspaces and all of them have Defender for Servers enabled, the machines are billed for each attached workspace.

      - question: |
          What's this "MDE.Windows" / "MDE.Linux" extension running on my machine?
        answer: |
          In the past, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint was provisioned by the Log Analytics agent. When [we expanded support to include Windows Server 2019](release-notes-archive.md#microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-integration-with-azure-defender-now-supports-windows-server-2019-and-windows-10-on-windows-virtual-desktop-released-for-general-availability-ga) and Linux, we also added an extension to perform the automatic onboarding.

          Defender for Cloud automatically deploys the extension to machines running:

          - Windows Server 2019 and Windows Server 2022
          - Windows Server 2012 R2 and 2016 if [MDE Unified Solution integration](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md#enable-the-integration) is enabled
          - Windows 10 on Azure Virtual Desktop.
          - Other versions of Windows Server if Defender for Cloud doesn't recognize the OS version (for example, when a custom VM image is used). In this case, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is still provisioned by the Log Analytics agent.
          - Linux.

          > [!IMPORTANT]
          > If you delete the MDE.Windows/MDE.Linux extension, it will not remove Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. To offboard the machine, see [Offboard Windows servers.](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-server-endpoints#offboard-windows-servers).

      - question: |
          I enabled the solution but the `MDE.Windows`/`MDE.Linux` extension isn't showing on my machine
        answer: |
          If you enabled the integration, but still don't see the extension running on your machines:

          1. You need to wait at least 12 hours to be sure there's an issue to investigate.
          1. If after 12 hours you still don't see the extension running on your machines, check that you've met [Prerequisites](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md#prerequisites) for the integration.
          1. Ensure you've enabled the [Microsoft Defender for Servers](defender-for-servers-introduction.md) plan for the subscriptions related to the machines you're investigating.
          1. If you've moved your Azure subscription between Azure tenants, some manual preparatory steps are required before Defender for Cloud will deploy Defender for Endpoint. For full details, [contact Microsoft support](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/overview).
          
      - question: |
          What are the licensing requirements for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint?
        answer: |
          Licenses for Defender for Endpoint for servers are included with **Microsoft Defender for Servers**.
          
      - question: |
          Do I need to buy a separate anti-malware solution to protect my machines?
        answer: |
          No. With MDE integration in Defender for Servers, you'll also get malware protection on your machines.

          - On Windows Server 2012 R2 with MDE unified solution integration enabled, Defender for Servers will deploy [Microsoft Defender Antivirus](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-antivirus-windows) in *active mode*.
          - On newer Windows Server operating systems, Microsoft Defender Antivirus is part of the operating system and will be enabled in *active mode*.
          - On Linux, Defender for Servers will deploy MDE including the anti-malware component, and set the component in *passive mode*.
                    
      - question: |
          If I already have a license for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, can I get a discount for Microsoft Defender for Servers?
        answer: |
          If you already have a license for **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for Servers** , you won't pay for that part of your [Microsoft Defender for Servers Plan 2](plan-defender-for-servers-select-plan.md#plan-features) license. Learn more about [the Microsoft 365 license](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/minimum-requirements#licensing-requirements).

          To request your discount, [contact Defender for Cloud's support team](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/overview). You'll need to provide the relevant workspace ID, region, and number of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for servers licenses applied for machines in the given workspace.

          The discount will be effective starting from the approval date, and won't take place retroactively.
          
      - question: |
          How do I switch from a third-party EDR tool?
        answer: |
          Full instructions for switching from a non-Microsoft endpoint solution are available in the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint documentation: [Migration overview](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/switch-to-microsoft-defender-migration).
          
      - question: |
          Which Microsoft Defender for Endpoint plan is supported in Defender for Servers?
        answer: |
          Defender for Servers Plan 1 and Plan 2 provides the capabilities of [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint).

      - question: |
          Are there any options to enforce the application controls?
        answer: |
          No enforcement options are currently available. Adaptive application controls are intended to provide **security alerts** if any application runs other than the ones you've defined as safe. They have a range of benefits ([What are the benefits of adaptive application controls?](adaptive-application-controls.md#what-are-the-benefits-of-adaptive-application-controls)) and are customizable as shown on this page.

      - question: |
          Why do I see a Qualys app in my recommended applications?
        answer: |
          [Microsoft Defender for Servers](defender-for-servers-introduction.md) includes vulnerability scanning for your machines at no extra cost. You don't need a Qualys license or even a Qualys account - everything's handled seamlessly inside Defender for Cloud. For details of this scanner and instructions for how to deploy it, see [Defender for Cloud's integrated Qualys vulnerability assessment solution](deploy-vulnerability-assessment-vm.md).

          To ensure no alerts are generated when Defender for Cloud deploys the scanner, the adaptive application controls recommended allowlist includes the scanner for all machines.

      - question: |
          Why aren't all of my resources shown, such as subscriptions, machines, storage accounts in my asset inventory?
        answer: |
          The inventory view lists your Defender for Cloud connected resources from a Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) perspective. The filters show only the resources with active recommendations.

          For example, if you have access to eight subscriptions but only seven currently have recommendations, filter by **Resource type = Subscriptions** shows only the seven subscriptions with active recommendations:

          :::image type="content" source="./media/asset-inventory/filtered-subscriptions-some.png" alt-text="Not all subscriptions returned when there are no active recommendations." lightbox="./media/asset-inventory/filtered-subscriptions-some.png":::

      - question: |
          Why do some of my resources show blank values in the Defender for Cloud or monitoring agent columns?
        answer: |
          Not all Defender for Cloud monitored resources require agents. For example, Defender for Cloud doesn't require agents to monitor Azure Storage accounts or PaaS resources, such as disks, Logic Apps, Data Lake Analysis, and Event Hubs.

          When pricing or agent monitoring isn't relevant for a resource, nothing will be shown in those columns of inventory.

          :::image type="content" source="./media/asset-inventory/agent-pricing-blanks.png" alt-text="Some resources show blank info in the monitoring agent  or Defender for Cloud columns." lightbox="./media/asset-inventory/agent-pricing-blanks.png":::

      - question: |
          Which ports are supported by adaptive network hardening?
        answer: |
          Adaptive network hardening recommendations are only supported on the following specific ports (for both UDP and TCP): 

          13, 17, 19, 22, 23, 53, 69, 81, 111, 119, 123, 135, 137, 138, 139, 161, 162, 389, 445, 512, 514, 593, 636, 873, 1433, 1434, 1900, 2049, 2301, 2323, 2381, 3268, 3306, 3389, 4333, 5353, 5432, 5555, 5800, 5900, 5900, 5985, 5986, 6379, 6379, 7000, 7001, 7199, 8081, 8089, 8545, 9042, 9160, 9300, 11211, 16379, 26379, 27017, 37215

      - question: |
          Are there any prerequisites or VM extensions required for adaptive network hardening?
        answer: |
          Adaptive network hardening is an agentless feature of Microsoft Defender for Cloud - nothing needs to be installed on your machines to benefit from this network hardening tool.

      - question: |
          When should I use a "Deny all traffic" rule?
        answer: |
          A **Deny all traffic** rule is recommended when, as a result of running the algorithm, Defender for Cloud does not identify traffic that should be allowed, based on the existing NSG configuration. Therefore, the recommended rule is to deny all traffic to the specified port. The name of this type of rule is displayed as "*System Generated*". After enforcing this rule, its actual name in the NSG will be a string comprised of the protocol, traffic direction, "DENY", and a random number.
