# Security recommendations for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources

This article lists all the recommendations you might see in Microsoft Defender for Cloud if you connect a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account by using the **Environment settings** page. The recommendations that appear in your environment are based on the resources that you're protecting and on your customized configuration.

To learn about actions that you can take in response to these recommendations, see [Remediate recommendations in Defender for Cloud](implement-security-recommendations.md).

Your secure score is based on the number of security recommendations you completed. To decide which recommendations to resolve first, look at the severity of each recommendation and its potential effect on your secure score.
