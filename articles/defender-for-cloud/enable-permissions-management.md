# Enable Permissions Management in Microsoft Defender for Cloud (Preview)

## Overview

Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM) is a security model that helps organizations manage and control user access and entitlements in their cloud infrastructure.

Microsoft delivers both CNAPP and CIEM solutions with Microsoft Defender for Cloud (CNAPP) and Microsoft Entra Permissions Management (CIEM). Integrating the capabilities of Permissions Management with Defender for Cloud strengthens the prevention of security breaches that can occur due to excessive permissions or misconfigurations in the cloud environment. By continuously monitoring and managing cloud entitlements, Permissions Management helps to reduce the attack surface, detect potential threats, and maintain compliance with regulatory standards. This makes Permissions Management an essential tool to integrate into the capabilities of Defender for Cloud for securing cloud-native applications and protecting sensitive data in the cloud.

## Common use-cases and scenarios

Permissions Management capabilities are available as part of the Defender CSPM plan. With these added capabilities, you can track permissions analytics, unused permissions for active identities, and over-permissioned identities and mitigate them to support the best practice of least privilege.

You can find new recommendations under the **All recommendations** tab.
