# Customize data sensitivity settings

This article describes how to customize data sensitivity settings in Microsoft Defender for Cloud. 

Data sensitivity settings are used to identify and focus on managing the critical sensitive data in your organization.

- The sensitive info types and sensitivity labels which come from Microsoft Purview portal and which you can select in Defender for Cloud. By default Defender for Cloud uses the [built-in sensitive information types](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitive-information-type-learn-about) provided by Microsoft Purview portal. A selection of these are enabled by default, and you can modify as needed.
- You can optionally allow the import of custom sensitive info types and allow the import of [sensitivity labels](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels) that you've defined in Microsoft Purview.
- If you import labels, you can set sensitivity thresholds that determine the minimum threshold sensitivity level for a label to be marked as sensitive in Defender for Cloud. 

This configuration helps you focus on your critical sensitive resources and improve the accuracy of the sensitivity insights.

## Before you start

You need one of these permissions in order to login and edit sensitivity settings: Global Administrator,  Compliance Administrator, Compliance Data Administrator, Security Administrator, Security Operator.

- [Review the prerequisites](concept-data-security-posture-prepare.md#configuring-data-sensitivity-settings) for customizing data sensitivity settings.
- In Defender for Cloud, enable sensitive data discovery capabilities in the [Defender CSPM](data-security-posture-enable.md) and/or [Defender for Storage](defender-for-storage-data-sensitivity.md) plans.

Note that changes in sensitivity settings take effect the next time that resources are scanned.

## Import custom sensitive info types/labels from Microsoft Purview portal

Defender for Cloud uses built-in sensitive info types. You can optionally import your own custom sensitive info types and labels from Microsoft Purview portal to align with your organization's needs. 

Import as follows (this is done only once):

1. Log into Microsoft Purview portal.
1. Navigate to Information Protection > [Labels](https://compliance.microsoft.com/informationprotection/labels).
1. In the consent notice message, select **Turn on** and then select **Yes** to share your custom info types and sensitivity labels with Defender for Cloud.

Note that:

- Imported labels appear in Defender for Cloud in the order rank that's set in Microsoft Purview.
- The two sensitivity labels that are set to highest priority in Microsoft Purview are turned on by default in Defender for Cloud.


## Customize sensitive data categories/types

To customize data sensitivity settings that appear in Defender for Cloud, review the [prerequisites](concept-data-security-posture-prepare.md#configuring-data-sensitivity-settings), and then do the following.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). 
1. Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** > **Environment settings**.
1. Select **Data sensitivity**.
1. Select the info type category that you want to customize:
    - The **Finance**, **PII**, and **Credentials** categories contain the default info type data that are typically sought out by attackers.
    - The **Custom** category contains custom info types from your Microsoft Purview portal configuration.
    - The **Other** category contains all of the rest of the built-in available info types.
1. Select the info types which you want to be marked as sensitive.
1. Select **Apply** and **Save**.

## Set the threshold for sensitive data labels

 You can set a threshold to determine the minimum sensitivity level for a label to be marked as sensitive in Defender for Cloud. 

If you're using Microsoft Purview sensitivity labels, make sure that:

-  the label scope is set to "Items"; under which you should configure [auto labeling for files and emails](/microsoft-365/compliance/apply-sensitivity-label-automatically#how-to-configure-auto-labeling-for-office-apps)
- labels must be [published](/microsoft-365/compliance/create-sensitivity-labels#publish-sensitivity-labels-by-creating-a-label-policy) with a label policy that is in effect. 

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). 
1. Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** > **Environment settings**.
1. Select **Data sensitivity**.
    The current minimum sensitivity threshold is shown.
1. Select **Change** to see the list of sensitivity labels and select the lowest sensitivity label that you want marked as sensitive.
1. Select **Apply** and **Save**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/concept-data-security-posture/sensitivity-threshold.png" alt-text="Graphic showing data sensitivity threshold.":::

Note that:

- When you turn on the threshold, you select a label with the lowest setting that should be considered sensitive in your organization.
- Any resources with this minimum label or higher are presumed to contain sensitive data.
- For example, if you select **Confidential** as minimum, then **Highly Confidential** is also considered sensitive. **General**, **Public**, and **Non-Business** aren't.
- Although you canâ€™t select a sub label in the threshold, you will be able to see the sub-label as the effected label on resources in attack path/Cloud Security Explorer if the parent label is part of the threshold (part of the sensitive labels selected).
