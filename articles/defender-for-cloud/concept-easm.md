# External attack surface management (EASM)

Microsoft Defender for Cloud's integration with Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Management (DEASM), allows organizations to improve their security posture while reducing the potential risk of being attacked by exploring their external attack surface. The integration is included with the Defender for Cloud Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) plan by default and doesn't require a license from DEASM or any special configurations.

Defender EASM applies Microsoft’s crawling technology to discover assets that are related to your known online infrastructure, and actively scans these assets to discover new connections over time. Attack Surface Insights are generated by applying vulnerability and infrastructure data to showcase the key areas of concern for your organization, such as:

- Discover of all the internet facing cloud resources through the use of an outside-in scan
- Attack path analysis which finds all exploitable paths starting from internet exposed IPs
- Custom queries that correlate all internet exposed IPs with the rest of Defender for Cloud data in the cloud security explorer

With this information, security and IT teams are able to identify unknowns, prioritize risks, eliminate threats, and extend vulnerability and exposure control beyond the firewall. The attack surface is made up of all the points of access that an unauthorized person could use to enter their system. The larger your attack surface is, the harder it's to protect.

EASM collects data on publicly exposed assets (“outside-in”) which Defender for Cloud's  Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) (“inside-out”) plan uses to assist with internet-exposure validation and discovery capabilities.

## Defender CSPM integration

The intergartion with Defender EASM is included with the Defender CSPM plan and doesn't require a license from DEASM.

While [Defender CSPM](concept-cloud-security-posture-management.md) includes some external attack surface management capabilities, it doesn't include the full EASM solution. Instead, it provides detection of internet accessible assets via Defender for Cloud recommendations and attack paths.
