# Find vulnerabilities and collect software inventory with agentless scanning

Agentless scanning provides visibility into installed software and software vulnerabilities on your workloads to extend vulnerability assessment coverage to server workloads without a vulnerability assessment agent installed.

Learn more about [agentless scanning](concept-agentless-data-collection.md).

Agentless vulnerability assessment uses the Defender Vulnerability Management engine to assess vulnerabilities in the software installed on your VMs, without requiring Defender for Endpoint to be installed. Vulnerability assessment shows software inventories and vulnerability results in the same format as the agent-based assessments.

## Compatibility with agent-based vulnerability assessment solutions

Defender for Cloud already supports different agent-based vulnerability scans, including [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)](deploy-vulnerability-assessment-tvm.md), [BYOL](deploy-vulnerability-assessment-byol-vm.md) and [Qualys](deploy-vulnerability-assessment-vm.md). Agentless scanning extends the visibility of Defender for Cloud to reach more devices.

If you use an integrated agent-based vulnerability assessment and want to use agentless vulnerability assessment also, the scan results are shown as described here:

- **Vulnerability assessment with MDE integration** - Unified and consolidated view that optimizes coverage and freshness.

    - Machines scanned by either by MDE or agentless show results automatically in Defender for Cloud. 
    - Machines scanned by both MDE and agentless show the agent-based results for the best data freshness.

- **Vulnerability assessment with Qualys or BYOL integrations** - Agentless results are shown for machines in that don't have an agent installed or that don't have findings correctly reported by the agent.

    If you want to specifically show the results from the agentless scan, use the [Microsoft threat and vulnerability management](auto-deploy-vulnerability-assessment.md#automatically-enable-a-vulnerability-assessment-solution) vulnerability assessment solution.

## Enabling agentless scanning for machines

When you enable Defender [Defender CSPM P1](concept-cloud-security-posture-management.md) or [Defender for Servers P2](defender-for-servers-introduction.md), agentless scanning is enabled on by default.

If you have Defender CSPM P1 or Defender for Servers P2 already enabled and agentless scanning is turned off, you need to turn on agentless scanning manually.

### Agentless vulnerability assessment on Azure

To enable agentless vulnerability assessment on Azure:

1. From Defender for Cloud's menu, open **Environment settings**.
1. Select the relevant subscription.
1. For either the CSPM P1 or Defender for Servers P2 plan, select **Settings**.

    When you enable agentless scanning on either plan, the setting applies to both plans.

1. In the settings pane, turn on **Agentless scanning for machines**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/deploy-vulnerability-assessment-agentless/agentless-scanning-off.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the agentless scanning status." lightbox="media/deploy-vulnerability-assessment-agentless/agentless-scanning-off.png":::

1. Select **Save**.

### Agentless vulnerability assessment on AWS

1. From Defender for Cloud's menu, open **Environment settings**.
1. Select the relevant subscription.
1. For either the CSPM P1 or Defender for Servers P2 plan, select **Settings**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/deploy-vulnerability-assessment-agentless/defender-plan-settings-aws.png" alt-text="Screenshot of link for the settings of the Defender plans for AWS accounts." lightbox="media/deploy-vulnerability-assessment-agentless/defender-plan-settings-aws.png":::

    When you enable agentless scanning on either plan, the setting applies to both plans.

1. In the settings pane, turn on **Agentless scanning for machines**.
 
    :::image type="content" source="media/deploy-vulnerability-assessment-agentless/agentless-scanning-off-aws.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the agentless scanning status for AWS accounts.":::

1. Select **Save and Next: Configure Access**.

1. Download the CloudFormation template.
    
1. Using the downloaded CloudFormation template, create the stack in AWS as instructed on screen. If you're onboarding a management account, you'll need to run the CloudFormation template both as Stack and as StackSet. Connectors will be created for the member accounts up to 24 hours after the onboarding.
    
1. Select **Next: Review and generate**.
    
1. Select **Update**.

## Exclude machines from scanning

Agentless scanning applies to all of the eligible machines in the subscription. To prevent specific machines from being scanned, exclude machines from agentless scanning based on your pre-existing environment tags. When Defender for Cloud performs the continuous discovery for machines, excluded machines are skipped.

To configure machines for exclusion:

1. From Defender for Cloud's menu, open **Environment settings**.
1. Select the relevant subscription.
1. For either the CSPM P1 or Defender for Servers P2 plan, select **Settings**.
1. For agentless scanning, select **Edit configuration**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/deploy-vulnerability-assessment-agentless/agentless-scanning-edit-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the link to edit the agentless scanning configuration." lightbox="media/deploy-vulnerability-assessment-agentless/agentless-scanning-edit-configuration.png":::

1. Enter the tag name and value that applies to the machines that you want to exempt. You can enter multiple tag:value pairs.

    :::image type="content" source="media/deploy-vulnerability-assessment-agentless/agentless-scanning-exclude-tags.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the tag and value fields for excluding machines from agentless scanning.":::

1. Select **Save** to apply the changes.

After you enable agentless scanning, software inventory and vulnerability information is updated automatically in Defender for Cloud.
