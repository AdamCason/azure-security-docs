# Delegate recommendations with Copilot for Security

Microsoft Defender for Cloud's integration with Microsoft Copilot for Security allows you to delegate recommendations that are present on the recommendations page with natural language prompts. Recommendations can be delegated to another person or team. 

Delegating recommendations can improve your security posture by having the right people address the risks and vulnerabilities presented by the recommendations that are present in your environment.

## Delegate a recommendation

Delegate recommendations to ensure the right person or team is handling the risks and vulnerabilities that are present in your environment.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Search for and select **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**.

1. Navigate to **Recommendations**.

1. Select a recommendation.

1. Select **Summarize with Copilot**.

1. Review the summary.

1. Select **Delegate the remediation to the resource owner**.

1. Review the result.

1. Select **here** to send an email to your colleague.

1. Review the email and add additional recipients.

1. Select **Send**.

Once you have delegated the recommendation, you can monitor the progress of the remediation on Defender for Cloud's recommendations page.
