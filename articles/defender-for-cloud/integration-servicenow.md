## Onboarding ServiceNow to Defender for Cloud

### Create an application registry in ServiceNOW
As part of the onboarding process, you need to have a Client ID and ClientSecret of the ServiceNow instance 
for integrating to Defender for Cloud. If you don’t know/have ClientID and ClientSecret, follow the steps 
below for the same. 
a. In order to create the API Client ID and Client Secret you need to login to ServiceNow with an 
account which has sufficient permissions to modify the Application Registry.
b. Once you have logged in, browse to the ‘System OAuth’ section and click ‘Application Registry’ and 
click the ‘New’ button.
c. Select the option ‘Create an OAuth API endpoint for external clients.
d. Fill in the OAuth Client application details in this screen inorder to create ‘Client ID’ and ‘Client 
Secret.’
Name: A descriptive name in the Name field (MDCIntegrationSNOW in our example)
Client ID: Client ID will be automatically generated by ServiceNow OAuth server.
Client Secret: Enter a secret or the client secret can be left empty if you want it to be auto 
generated. This refers to the Client secret for the OAuth application.
Refresh Token lifespan: Time in seconds the Refresh token will be valid. 
Access Token lifespan: Time in seconds the Access token will be valid.

NOTE: The default value of RefreshToken Lifespan is too small, we recommend to increase the Token 
Lifespan to as maximum as possible to give it a long life so that you don’t need to refresh the token 
soon.

Click on the Submit button to save the API Client ID and Client Secret. (Refer example screenshot 
below) 
After you complete the steps above, you can use this user for integrating the instance to Microsoft 
Defender for Cloud.
