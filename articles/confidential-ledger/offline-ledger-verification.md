# Offline Ledger verification

In addition to interacting with the Ledger, it is possible to verify the Ledger's integrity via [TamperCheck](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_git/ACC%20Ledger?path=%2Fsrc%2Ftampertool%2FREADME.md&version=GBmaster&_a=preview&line=1), a Python tool to verify CCF [DEFINE THIS ACRONYM] ledger integrity while offline. You can run this tool locally by copying all Ledger blocks or set up an Azure Web Job or Azure Function.
