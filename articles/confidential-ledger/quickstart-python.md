# Quickstart: Microsoft Azure Confidential Ledger client library for Python

Get started with the Microsoft Azure Confidential Ledger client library for Python. Follow the steps below to install the package and try out example code for basic tasks.

Microsoft Azure Confidential Ledger is a new and highly secure service for managing sensitive data records. Based on a permissioned blockchain model, Confidential Ledger offers unique data integrity advantages, such as immutability (making the ledger write-only) and tamperproofing (to ensure all records are kept intact).


[API reference documentation](/python/api/overview/azure/keyvault-secrets-readme) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-secrets) | [Package (Python Package Index)](https://pypi.org/project/azure-keyvault-secrets/)

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- [Python 3.6+](/azure/developer/python/configure-local-development-environment)
- [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

This quickstart assumes you are running [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) in a Linux or [WSL](/windows/wsl/) terminal window.

## Set up your local environment

This quickstart uses the Azure Identity library with Azure CLI to authenticate user to Azure Services. Developers can also use Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code to authenticate their calls, for more information, see [Authenticate the client with Azure Identity client library](/python/api/overview/azure/identity-readme).

### Sign in to Azure

1. Run the `login` command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az login
    ```

    If the CLI can open your default browser, it will do so and load an Azure sign-in page.

    Otherwise, open a browser page at [https://aka.ms/devicelogin](https://aka.ms/devicelogin) and enter the
    authorization code displayed in your terminal.

2. Sign in with your account credentials in the browser.

### Install the packages

1. In a terminal or command prompt, create a suitable project folder, and then create and activate a Python virtual environment as described on [Use Python virtual environments](/azure/developer/python/configure-local-development-environment?tabs=cmd#use-python-virtual-environments).

1. Install the Azure Active Directory identity client library:

    ```terminal
    pip install azure-identity
    ```

1. Install the Confidential Ledger control plane client library.

    ```terminal
    pip install azure.mgmt.confidentialledger
    ```
1. Install the Confidential Ledger data plane client library.

    ```terminal
    pip install azure.confidentialledger 
    ```

### Create a resource group

A resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed. Use the Azure CLI [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az_group_create) command to create a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* location.

```azurecli
az group create --name "myResourceGroup" -l "EastUS"
```

## Create your python app

### Initialization

We can now start writing our python application.  First, we'll import the required packages.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

## Import control plane sdk

from azure.mgmt.confidentialledger import ConfidentialLedger as ConfidentialLedgerAPI
from azure.mgmt.confidentialledger.models import ConfidentialLedger

# import data plane sdk

from azure.confidentialledger import ConfidentialLedgerClient
from azure.confidentialledger.identity_service import ConfidentialLedgerIdentityServiceClient
```

Next, we'll use the [DefaultAzureCredential Class](/python/api/azure-identity/azure.identity.defaultazurecredential) to authenticate the the app.

```python
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
```

We'll finish setup by setting some variables for use in your application: the resource group (myResourceGroup), the name of ledger you want to create, and two urls to be used by the data plane client library.

  > [!Important]
  > Each ledger must have a globally unique name. Replace <your-unique-keyvault-name> with the name of your ledger in the following example.

```python
resource_group = "myResourceGroup"
ledger_name = "<your-unique-ledger-name>"

identity_url = "https://identity.accledger.azure.com"
ledger_url = "https://" + ledger_name + ".eastus.cloudapp.azure.com"
```

### Use the control plane client library

The control plane client library (azure.mgmt.confidentialledger) allows operations on ledgers, such as creating, updating, and deleting ledgers, listing the ledgers associated with a subscription, and getting the details of a specific ledger.

In our code, we will first create a ledger using `begin_create`. The `begin_create` function requires three parameters: your resource group, a name for the ledger, and a "properties" object.  Create a `properties` dictionary, and then assign it to a variable.

```python
properties = {
    "location": "eastus",
    "tags": {},
    "properties": {
        "ledgerType": "Public",
        "ledgerStorageAccount": "contosoledger",
        "aadBasedSecurityPrincipals": [],
    },
}

ledger_properties = ConfidentialLedger(**properties)
```

Now pass the resource group, the name of your ledger, and the properties object, to `begin_create`.

```python
confidential_ledger_mgmt.ledger.begin_create(resource_group, ledger_name, ledger_properties)
```

To verify that your ledger was successfully created, view its details using the `get` function.

```python
myledger = ledger = confidential_ledger_mgmt.ledger.get(resource_group, ledger_name)

print("Here are the details of your newly created ledger:")
print (f"- Name: {myledger.name}")
print (f"- Location: {myledger.location}")
print (f"- ID: {myledger.id}")

```

### Use the data plane client library

Now that we have a ledger, we'll interact with it using the data plane client library (azure.confidentialledger). To do so, we must first create a Confidential Ledger client.  

```python
identity_client = ConfidentialLedgerIdentityServiceClient(identity_url)
network_identity = identity_client.get_ledger_identity(
     ledger_id=ledger_name
)

ledger_tls_cert_file_name = "networkcert.pem"
with open(ledger_tls_cert_file_name, "w") as cert_file:
     cert_file.write(network_identity.ledger_tls_certificate)

ledger_client = ConfidentialLedgerClient(
     endpoint=ledger_url, 
     credential=credential,
     ledger_certificate_path=ledger_tls_cert_file_name
)

```

We are now prepared to write to the ledger.  We will do so using the `append_to_ledger` function.

```python
append_result = ledger_client.append_to_ledger(entry_contents="Hello world!")
print(write_result.transaction_id)
```

## Full sample code


```python
TODO
```

## Clean up resources

Other Microsoft Azure Confidential Ledger articles can build upon this quickstart. If you plan to continue on to work with subsequent quickstarts and tutorials, you may wish to leave these resources in place.

Otherwise, when you're finished with the resources created in this article, use the Azure CLI [az group delete](/cli/azure/group?#az_group_delete) command to delete the resource group and all its contained resources:

```azurecli
az group delete --resource-group myResourceGroup
```
