# Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

Find answers to common questions about Microsoft Azure Dedicated HSM.

## Basics

### Q: What is a hardware security module (HSM)?

A Hardware Security Module (HSM) is a physical computing device used to safeguard and manage cryptographic keys. Keys stored in HSMs can be used for cryptographic operations. The key material stays safely in tamper-resistant, tamper-evident hardware modules. The HSM only allows authenticated and authorized applications to use the keys. The key material never leaves the HSM protection boundary.

## What hardware is used for Dedicated HSM?

Microsoft has partnered with Gemalto to provide the Azure Dedicated HSM service. The specific device used is the SafeNet Luna Network HSM 7 Model A790.  The product brief can be found here that has detailed specifications.  
This device not only provides FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validation but also offers low-latency, high performance, and high capacity via 10 partitions. 
Gemalto supplies all software for the HSM device once provisioned by Microsoft. The software is available at the Gemalto customer support portal. Customers using Dedicated HSM service are required to be registered with Gemalto and have a Customer ID that enables access and download of relevant software. The supported client software is version 7.2 and is compatible with the FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated firmware version 7.0.3.
It is a deliberate feature of the service that once provisioned to a customer, Microsoft and Gemalto have no access or control over it. This offering meets the stringent security needs of the typical customers of this service. The features of this service also have implications in terms of support limitations and inability to offer a service level agreement.

### Q: What is an HSM used for?

HSMs are used for storing cryptographic keys that are used for cryptographic functionality such as SSL (secure socket layer), encrypting data, PKI (public key infrastructure), DRM (digital rights management), and signing documents.

### Q: What is Dedicated HSM offering?

Azure Dedicated HSM (hardware security module) is a cloud-based service that provides HSMs hosted in Azure datacenters that are directly connected to a customer's VNET. These HSMs are dedicated network appliances (Gemalto's SafeNet Network HSM 7 Model A790). They are deployed to customers' private IP address space and Microsoft does not have any access to the cryptographic functionality of the HSMs. Customers are the only ones who have full administrative and cryptographic control over these devices. They can get full activity logs directly from their devices. Dedicated HSMs help customers meet compliance/regulatory requirements such as FIPS 140-2 Level 3, GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and eIDAS and many others.

### Q: How does Dedicated HSM work?

Customers can provision HSMs in specific regions using PowerShell or command-line interface. The customer specifies what VNET the HSMs will be connected to and once provisioned the HSMs will be available in the designated subnet at assigned IP addresses in the customer's private IP address space. Then customers can connect to the HSMs using SSH for appliance management and administration, set up HSM client connections, initialize HSMs, create partitions, define, and assign roles such as partition officer, crypto officer, and crypto user. Then the customer will use Gemalto provided HSM client tools/SDK/software to perform cryptographic operations from their applications.

### Q: When will Dedicated HSM be available in my region?

Dedicated HSMs will roll out to limited Azure regions starting November 2018. See the roll-out schedule below:

## Interoperability

### Q: How does my application connect to a Dedicated HSM?

You use Gemalto provided HSM client tools/SDK/software to perform cryptographic operations from your applications.

### Q: Can an application connect to Dedicated HSM from a different VNET in or across regions?

Yes, you will need to use [VNET peering](../virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview.md) (in same region or across regions) to establish connectivity across VNETs.

### Q: Can I sync Dedicated HSM with on-premises HSMs?

Yes, you can sync on-premises HSMs with Dedicated HSM. [Point-to-point VPN or point-to-site](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways.md) connectivity can be used to establish connectivity with your on-premises network.

### Q: Can I encrypt data used by other Azure services using keys stored in Dedicated HSM?

No. Azure Dedicated HSMs are only accessible from inside your VNET.

### Q: Can I import keys from an existing On-prem HSM to Dedicated HSM?

Yes, if you have on-premises SafeNet HSMs. There are multiple methods. Refer to the Gemalto HSM documentation.

### Q: What operating systems are supported by Dedicated HSM client software?

* Windows, Linux, Solaris*, AIX*, HP-UX*, FreeBSD
* Virtual: VMware, hyperv, Xen, KVM

### Q: How do I configure my client application to create high availability configuration with multiple partitions from multiple HSMs?

To have high availability, you need to set up your HSM client application configuration to use partitions from multiple HSMs. Refer to Gemalto HSM client software documentation.

### Q: What authentication mechanisms are supported by Dedicated HSM?

Azure Dedicated HSM uses SafeNet Network HSM 7 appliances (model A790) and they support password-based authentication.

### Q: What SDKs, APIs, client software is available to use with Dedicated HSM?

PKCS#11, Java (JCA/JCE), Microsoft CAPI, and CNG, OpenSSL

## When do I use it?

### Q: How do I decide whether to use Azure Key Vault or Azure Dedicated HSM?

Azure Dedicated HSM is the appropriate choice for enterprises migrating to Azure on-premises applications that use HSMs. Dedicated HSMs present an option to migrate an application with minimal changes. If cryptographic operations are performed in the application's code running in an Azure VM or Web App, they can use Dedicated HSM. In general, shrink-wrapped software running in IaaS (infrastructure as a service) models, that support HSMs as a key store can use Dedicate HSM, such as Application gateway or traffic manager for keyless SSL, ADCS (Active Directory Certificate Services), or similar PKI tools, tools/applications used for document signing, code signing, or a SQL Server (IaaS) configured with TDE (transparent database encryption) with master key in an HSM using an EKM (extensible key management) provider. Azure Key Vault is suitable for “born-in-cloud” applications or for encryption at rest scenarios where customer data is processed by PaaS (platform as a service) or SaaS (Software as a service) scenarios such as Office 365 Customer Key, Azure Information Protection, Azure Disk Encryption, Azure Data Lake Store encryption with customer-managed key, Azure Storage encryption with customer managed key, and Azure SQL with customer managed key.

### Q: What usage scenarios can Dedicated HSM be used for?

Azure Dedicated HSM is most suitable for "lift-and-shift" scenarios. This means that if you are migrating on-premises applications to Azure that are already using HSMs. This provides a low-friction option to migrate to Azure with minimal changes to the application. If cryptographic operations are performed in the application's code running in Azure VM or Web App Dedicated HSM may be used. In general, shrink-wrapped software running in IaaS (infrastructure as a service) models, that support HSMs as a key store can use Dedicate HSM, such as Application gateway or traffic manager for keyless SSL, ADCS (Active Directory Certificate Services), or similar PKI tools, tools/applications used for document signing, code signing, or a SQL Server (IaaS) configured with TDE (transparent database encryption) with master key in an HSM using an EKM (extensible key management) provider.

### Q: Can Dedicated HSM be used with Office 365 Customer Key, Azure Information Protection, Azure Data Lake Store, Disk Encryption, Azure Storage encryption, Azure SQL TDE?

No. Dedicated HSM is provisioned directly into a customer’s private IP Address space so it does not support integration with the Azure services listed.

## Administration, access, and control

### Q: Does the customer get full exclusive control over the HSMs with Dedicated HSMs?

Yes. Each network HSM appliance is fully dedicated to one single customer.

### Q: What level of access does Microsoft have to my HSM?

Microsoft does not have any administrative or cryptographic control over the HSM.

### Q: Can Microsoft or anyone at Microsoft access keys in my Dedicated HSM?

No. Microsoft does not have any access to the keys stored in customer allocated Dedicated HSM.

### Q: Can I upgrade software/firmware on HSMs allocated to me?

Azure Dedicated HSM gives full administrative control of the HSM appliance to the customer, including upgrading software/firmware. However, Microsoft will only support the HSM software/firmware that comes installed by default when the device is provisioned. Newer software/firmware versions do not immediately receive FIPS certification, so upgrading firmware/software may make the device fall out of FIPS compliance.

### Q: How do I manage Dedicated HSM?

You can manage Dedicated HSMs by accessing them using SSH.

### Q: How do I manage partitions on the Dedicated HSM?

The Gemalto HSM client software is used to manage the HSMs and partitions.

### Q: How do I monitor my HSM?

A customer has full access to HSM activity logs via syslog and SNMP. A customer will need to set up a syslog server or SNMP server to receive the logs or events from the HSMs.

### Q: Can I get full access log of all HSM operations from Dedicated HSM?

Yes. You can send logs from the HSM appliance to a syslog server

## High availability

### Q: Is it possible to configure high-availability in the same region or across multiple regions?

Yes. High availability configuration and setup are performed in the HSM client software provided by Gemalto. HSMs from the same VNET or other VNETs in the same region or across regions, or on-prem HSMs connected to a VNET using site-to-site or point-to-point VPN can be added to same high availability configuration.

### Q: How many HSMs can I add to the same high availability configuration from one single application?

16.

## Support

### Q: What is the SLA for Dedicated HSM service?

At this time, there is no SLA provided for Dedicated HSM service.  Microsoft will ensure network level access to the device, and hence standard Azure networking SLAs apply.

### Q: How are the HSMs used in Azure Dedicated HSM protected?

Azure datacenters have extensive physical and procedural security controls. In addition to that Dedicated HSMs are hosted in a further restricted access area of the datacenter. These areas have additional physical access controls and video camera surveillance for added security.

### Q: What happens if there is a security breach or hardware tampering event?

Dedicated HSM service uses SafeNet Network HSM 7 appliances. These appliances support physical and logical tamper detection. If there is ever a tamper event the HSMs are automatically zeroized.

### Q: How do I ensure that keys in my Dedicated HSMs are not lost due to error or a malicious insider attack?

It is highly recommended to use an on-premises HSM backup device to perform regular periodic backup of the HSMs for disaster recovery. You will need to use a peer-to-peer or site-to-site VPN connection to an on-premises workstation connected to an HSM backup device.

### Q: How do I get support for Dedicated HSM?

The same way you get support for all other Azure services. The Azure support team will escalate to Gemalto support as necessary depending on the case.

### Q: How do I get access to Dedicated HSM client software, documentation, firmware images?

Customer must work directly with Gemalto to get access to HSM client software, documentation, OS/firmware images.

### Q: If there is a security vulnerability found and a patch is released by Gemalto, who is responsible for upgrading/patching OS/Firmware?

Microsoft does not have the ability to connect to HSMs allocated to customers. Customer must upgrade and patch the HSMs.
