# Frequently asked questions for Microsoft Azure Attestation

This article provides answers to some of the most common questions about [Azure Attestation](overview.md).

If your Azure issue is not addressed in this article, you can also submit an Azure support request on the [Azure support page](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/options/).

**DCsv2 virtual machines are grayed out in the portal and I can't select one**

Based on the information bubble next to the VM, there are different actions to take:
   -	**UnsupportedGeneration**: Change the generation of the virtual machine image to “Gen2”.
   -	**NotAvailableForSubscription**: The region isn't yet available for your subscription. Select an available region.
   -	**InsufficientQuota**: [Create a support request to increase your quota](../azure-portal/supportability/per-vm-quota-requests.md). Free trial subscriptions don't have quota for confidential computing VMs. 

**What validations does Azure Attestation perform**

**How to shift to Azure Attestation from other attestation models**

**How can a verifier obtain the attestation collateral supported by Azure Attestation**

**Does Azure Attestation support the attestation of enclaves in environments other than Azure**

**How can the relying party verify the integrity of attestation token**

Attestation token is generated by Azure Attestation is signed using a self-signed certificate. The certificates are exposed via an [OpenID metadata endpoint](/rest/api/attestation/metadataconfiguration/get). Relying party can retrieve the signing certificates from this endpoint and perform signature verification of the attestation token. Validity time of the attestation token is 8 hours

**How to identify the certificate to be used for signature verification of the attestation token from the OpenID metadata endpoint**

The multiple certificates exposed in the OpenID metadata endpoint corresponds to different use cases (e.g. SGX attestation) supported by Azure Attestation. As per the standards specified by [RFC 7515](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515), the certificate with key id (kid) matching the kid parameter in the attestation token header is to be used for signature verification. If no matching kid is found, then it is expected to try all the certificates exposed by OpenID metadata endpoint.

**Is it possible for the relying party to share secrets with the validated Trusted Execution Environemnts (TEEs)**

Public key generated within an enclave can be expressed in the Enclave Held Data (EHD) property of the attestation request object sent by the client to Azure Attestation. Azure Attestation validates if SHA256 hash of EHD matches the first 32 bytes in reportData field of the enclave quote. Azure Attestation includes “Enclave Held Data” in the attestation token. Relying party can use the enclave held data from the verified attestation response to encrypt the secrets beforing sharing with the enclave.
