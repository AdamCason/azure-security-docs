# Microsoft Azure Attestation troubleshooting guide

Error handling in Azure Attestation is implemented following [Microsoft REST API guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/vNext/Guidelines.md#7102-error-condition-responses). The error response returned by Azure Attestation APIs contains HTTP status code and name/value pairs with the names “code” and “message”. The value of “code” is human-readable and is an indicator of the type of error. The value of “message” intends to aid the user and provides error details.

If your issue is not addressed in this article, you can also submit an Azure support request on the [Azure support page](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/options/).

## HTTP – 401:Unauthorized exception
