# Claim sets

Claims generated in the process of attesting enclaves using Microsoft Azure Attestation can be divided into the below categories:

- **Incoming claims**: Claims generated by Microsoft Azure Attestation after parsing the attestation evidence.

- **Outgoing claims**: Claims created as an output by Azure Attestation. It contains all the claims that should end up in the attestation token.

- **Property claims**: Claims created as an output by Azure Attestation. It contains all the claims that represent properties of the attestation token, such as encoding of the report, validity duration of the report, and so on.

Below claims that are defined by the [IETF JWT](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) and used by Azure Attestation in the response object:

- **"jti" (JWT ID) Claim**
- **"iss" (Issuer) Claim**
- **"iat" (Issued At) Claim**
- **"exp" (Expiration Time) Claim**
- **"nbf" (Not Before) Claim**

Below claims that are defined by the [IETF EAT](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-rats-eat-01.html#rfc.section.3.1) and used by Azure Attestation in the response object:
- **Nonce claim**

Below claims are generated by Azure Attestation:
- **x-ms-ver**: JWT schema version (expected to be "1.0")
- **x-ms-attestation-type**: String value representing attestation type 
- **x-ms-policy-hash**: Hash of Azure Attestation evaluation policy computed as BASE64URL(SHA256(UTF8(BASE64URL(UTF8(policy text)))))
- **x-ms-policy-signer**: JSON object with a "jwk” member representing the key a customer used to sign their policy, when customer uploads a signed policy

## Claims issued by Azure Attestation in SGX enclaves

### Incoming claims 

- **$is-debuggable**: A Boolean, which indicates whether or not the enclave has debugging enabled or not
- **$sgx-mrsigner**: hex encoded value of the “mrsigner” field of the quote
- **$sgx-mrenclave**: hex encoded value of the “mrenclave” field of the quote
- **$product-id**
- **$svn**: security version number encoded in the quote 
- **$tee**: type of enclave 

### Outgoing claims

- **is-debuggable**: A Boolean, which indicates whether or not the enclave has debugging enabled or not
- **sgx-mrsigner**: hex encoded value of the “mrsigner” field of the quote
- **sgx-mrenclave**: hex encoded value of the “mrenclave” field of the quote
- **product-id**
- **svn**: security version number encoded in the quote 
- **tee**: type of enclave 
- **maa-ehd**:  Base64Url encoded version of the “Enclave Held Data” specified in the attestation request 
- **aas-ehd**:  Base64Url encoded version of the “Enclave Held Data” specified in the attestation request 

## Claims issued by Azure Attestation in VBS enclaves

### Incoming claims (can also be used as outgoing claims)

- **aikValidated**:  Boolean value containing information if the Attestation Identity Key (AIK) cert has been validated or not.
- **aikPubHash**:  String containing the base64(SHA256(AIK public key in DER format)).
- **tpmVersion**:   Integer value containing the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) major version.
- **secureBootEnabled**: Boolean value to indicate if secure boot is enabled.
- **iommuEnabled**:  Boolean value to indicate if Input-output memory management unit (Iommu) is enabled.
- **bootDebuggingDisabled**: Boolean value to indicate if boot debugging is disabled.
- **notSafeMode**:  Boolean value to indicate if the Windows is not running on safe mode.
- **notWinPE**:  Boolean value indicating if Windows is not running in WinPE mode.
- **vbsEnabled**:  Boolean value indicating if VBS is enabled.
- **vbsReportPresent**:  Boolean value indicating if VBS enclave report is available.
- **enclaveAuthorId**:  String value containing the Base64Url encoded value of the enclave author id-The author identifier of the primary module for the enclave.
- **enclaveImageId**:  String value containing the Base64Url encoded value of the enclave Image id-The image identifier of the primary module for the enclave.
- **enclaveOwnerId**:  String value containing the Base64Url encoded value of the enclave Owner id-The identifier of the owner for the enclave.
- **enclaveFamilyId**:  String value containing the Base64Url encoded value of the enclave Family id. The family identifier of the primary module for the enclave.
- **enclaveSvn**:  Integer value containing the security version number of the primary module for the enclave.
- **enclavePlatformSvn**:  Integer value containing the security version number of the platform that hosts the enclave.
- **enclaveFlags**:  The enclaveFlags claim is an Integer value containing Flags that describe the runtime policy for the enclave.
  
### Outgoing claims

- **policy_hash**:  String value containing SHA256 hash of the policy text computed by BASE64URL(SHA256(BASE64URL(UTF8(Policy text)))).
- **policy_signer**:  Contains a JWK with the public key or the certificate chain present in the signed policy header.
- **ver (Version)**:  String value containing version of the report. Currently 1.0.
- **cnf (Confirmation) Claim**:  The "cnf" claim is used to identify the proof-of-possession key. Confirmation claim as defined in RFC 7800, contains the public part of the attested enclave key represented as a JSON Web Key (JWK) object (RFC 7517).
- **rp_data (relying party data)**:  Relying party data, if any, specified in the request, used by the relying party as a nonce to guarantee freshness of the report.
- **"jti" (JWT ID) Claim**: The "jti" (JWT ID) claim provides a unique identifier for the JWT. The identifier value is assigned in a manner that ensures that there is a negligible probability that the same value will be accidentally assigned to a different data object.

### Property claims

- **report_validity_in_minutes**: An integer claim signifying for how long the token is valid.
  - **Default value(time)**: One day in minutes.
  - **Maximum value(time)**: One year in minutes.
- **omit_x5c**: A Boolean claim indicating if Azure Attestation should omit the cert used to provide proof of service authenticity. If true, x5t will be added to the attestation token. If false(default), x5c will be added to the attestation token.
